# ⚠️ WIP Battleship project ⚔️⚓

Built to practice TDD.


## UPDATE: This project has been "archived". Test Driven Development was learned, and I simply did not want to spend 4 weeks building out the dreamed UI.


[This codepen](https://codepen.io/BiffCodes/pen/jOpWLoz) demonstrates what the shooting could feel like.

Below is a mockup of what the UI could look like.
